# Ledger
Ledger is a small program that I initially designed and created in the summer of 2018. 
In early 2018, I became heavily interested in cryptocurrencies, and as I explored them further, I was frustrated in not having a "central ledger" in which I could check the balances of all my coins as well as the current net worth of all my coins.
Thus I created Ledger in an attempt to organize my coins and check their total worth in one single place.
As of now, there are 7 cryptocurrencies supported; users can manually enter the amount of each coin they have into the program, and the program will look at CoinMarketCap and calculate the total worth of each quantity of coin, as well as a grand total.
